"""
About:

The about module/app covers the various webpages for the about section of the webpage. This section contains overview about what TBP is, how to join, who the leaders are, and where to find the governing documents. The module does not contain any "data" models; its only models are to allow easier editing of the "static" content.

About is predominantly an outward facing page. No credentials are required to view the content. The only exception is that sufficient permissions must be present to see/interact with the page editing. Edits to governing documents and leadership are done thru the admin and membership interfaces, respectively.
