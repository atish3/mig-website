Beginning with the campaign, our mission as a team has been clear: help great organizations use their Big Data to solve their biggest problems. For the Obama team, we built technology platforms that integrated data across offline and online programs, developed hundreds of statistical models to identify the most effective voter contact targets, and helped the campaign improve its efficiency and effectiveness through testing, training and learning.
